                               <p>PT KBI focus on financial technology platform that connects developers (contractors), consumers, investors, landowners, notaries and banks in the development of RSH in mutual cooperation.
                            Welfare is determined by the availability of food needs, clothing and shelter. Board = residential, decent housing ownership is relatively difficult to reach for low-income people.</p>
                             <p>"Until 2019 there will be efforts to build 4 million low-cost housing with a budget of Rp74 trillion," said Minister of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR), Basuki Hadimuljono, as quoted by Antaranews.com, Saturday (12/8).</p>
                             <p>According to him, the target of 4 million low-cost housing was set with reference to the rapid progress of the construction of low-cost housing up to this year. Since the launch of a million low-cost housing program in 2015 to 2016 has been realized 1.5 million housing units, while in 2017-August 2017 has realized 449,000 housing units.</p>
                             <p>"That is, the provision of low-cost housing is still a priority for President Joko Widodo. This also addresses the backlog of 11.6 million houses," he said. (artikel.rumah123.com/hingga-2019-masih-akan-dibangun-lagi-4-juta-rumah-murah-38964#8HzhSbxSkPxOWA0e.99).</p>

                                <p>Basically, the wall plastering has the aim to cover the arrangement of bricks so that the partner is stronger and neater. From this, it is clearly seen that the quality of the plaster given can affect the durability of the building walls. So if you want to have strong and sturdy walls, you shouldn't underestimate the work of plastering walls. Try to make every job done in the development process always optimal so that the results are optimal.</p>
                            <p>Calculating Cement and Sand Needs in Plastering Walls. Now, to calculate the cement and sand requirements in this plastering wall is not difficult. But even so, you still may not just as long in determining the composition or make a plastering mortar. This is because in the calculation process, you must still hold the safety standards for this work. Then how do you get the right composition? You only need to apply the right calculation formula using a simple multiplication system.</p>
                            <p>Basically according to SNI 2008 there are three types of compositions in the ratio between cement and sand in using a mortar. The cement comparison here will be marked with a PC while the sand comparison uses the PP mark. For this calculation, we use a size of 1 sack with a weight of 40 kg. Well, this time we will discuss 3 types of sand and cement comparison compositions used in making mortar wall plastering as follows:
                                <ol><li>1. Plastering with 1 PC composition: 4 PP
In SNI 2008, the making of a plastering mortar that uses a ratio of 1 PC: 4 PP with the amount of cement 6.24 kg / m2 and sand 0.024 m3 / m2. Now, from this calculation, you can find out the amount of cement and sand needed by multiplying the size of the area to be plastered with this calculation.
So suppose you want to plaster a wall with a size of 15 x 6 m then the amount of cement needed is (15 × 6) x 6.24 = 90 x 6.24 = 561.6 kg or about 14.04 bags. Then for the sand needs are (15 × 6) x 0.024 = 90 x 0.024 = 2.16 m3.</li>
<li>2. Plastering with 1 PC composition: 5 PP
In SNI 2008, the making of a mortar that uses a ratio of 1 PC: 5 PP with the amount of cement 5.18 kg / m2 and sand 0.026 m3 / m2. Now, from this calculation, you can find out the amount of cement and sand needed by multiplying the size of the area to be plastered with this calculation.
So suppose you want to plaster a wall with a size of 15 x 6 m, the amount of cement needed is (15 × 6) x 5.18 = 90 x 5.18 = 466.2 kg or about 11,655 bags. Then for the sand needs are (15 × 6) x 0.026 = 90 x 0.026 = 2.34 m3.</li>
<li>3. Plastering with 1 PC composition: 6 PP
In SNI 2008, the making of a plastering mortar that uses a ratio of 1 PC: 6 PP with the amount of cement 4.42 kg / m2 and sand 0.027 m3 / m2. Now, from this calculation, you can find out the amount of cement and sand needed by multiplying the size of the area to be plastered with this calculation.
So suppose you want to plaster a wall with a size of 15 x 6 m, the amount of cement needed is (15 × 6) x 4.42 = 90 x 4.42 = 397.8 kg or about 9,945 bags. Then for the sand needs are (15 × 6) x 0.027 = 90 x 0.027 = 2.43 m3.</li></ol>
